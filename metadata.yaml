description: Jocelyn, the King's ward, escapes England in a bride-ship bound for the
  colonies and for her own reasons marries a planter who has decided--on a throw of
  dice--to come to Jamestown for the arrival of the brides. Their uncertain path is
  complicated by the arrival of the powerful suitor Jocelyn hoped to escape.
